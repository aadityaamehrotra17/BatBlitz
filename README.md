**Additional Information**

- High scores are stored in 'files/leaderboard.txt'. These can be edited using any text editor, which will then be reflected in the game.
- Saved data is stored in 'files/save.dat' in binary format. Only one game can be saved at any given time. New saves overwrite pre-existing data.
- One can customise the gameplay by replacing the images in the 'images' folder (making sure not to change the image names).
